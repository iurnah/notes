## S2E.h

About 248 line of code, declare two data structure `struct S2EShared` for sych among multiple instances of S2E, and `class S2E` for initialize . The `struct S2EShared` is:

```cpp
//Structure used for synchronization among multiple instances of S2E
struct S2EShared {
    unsigned currentProcessCount;
    unsigned lastFileId;
    //We must have unique state ids across all processes
    //otherwise offline tools will be extremely confused when
    //aggregating different execution trace files.
    unsigned lastStateId;

    //Array of currently running instances.
    //Each entry either contains -1 (no instance running) or
    //the instance index.
    unsigned processIds[S2E_MAX_PROCESSES];
    unsigned processPids[S2E_MAX_PROCESSES];
    S2EShared() {
        for (unsigned i=0; i<S2E_MAX_PROCESSES; ++i)    {
            processIds[i] = (unsigned)-1;
            processPids[i] = (unsigned)-1;
        }
    }
};
```

The `S2E` maintain some variables and data structures for QUME. At this moment, I don't get into QEMU and LLVM. `S2E` member functions include: 
- `getConfig()`, 
- `getPlugin()`, 
- `getCorePlugin()`, 
- `getOutputDirectory()`, 
- `getOutputFilename()`, 
- `openOutputFile()`, 
- `getInfoStream()`, 
- `getDebugStream()`, 
- `getMessagesStream()`, 
- `getWarningStream()`, 
- `getExecutor()`, 
- `refreshPlugins()`, 
- `writeBitCodeToFile()`, 
- `fork()`, 
- `isForking()`, 
- `fetchAndIncrementStateID()`, 
- `fetchNextStable()`, 
- `getMaxProcesses()`, 
- `getCurrentProcessId()`, 
- `getCurrentProcessIndex()`, 
- `getProcessIndexForId()`, 
- `getCurrentProcessCount()`, 
- `checkDeadProcesses()`, 
- `getStartTime()`. 


Most of those member functions are for QEMU to call. Generally, it is the S2E API for QEMU. _The Plugins are talk to QEMU through S2E class._

## S2E.cpp

Implementation of all the member functions that declared in the `S2E.h` file. We need to take a look at the `fork()` implementation. Nothing special until line 680, following is an exert from line 680 to line 709:

```cpp
        ...
        m_currentProcessIndex = newProcessIndex;
        //We are the child process, setup the log files again
        initOutputDirectory(m_outputDirectoryBase, 0, true);
        //Also recreate new statistics files
        m_s2eExecutor->initializeStatistics();
        //And the solver output
        m_s2eExecutor->initializeSolver();

        m_forking = true;

        qemu_init_cpu_loop(); /**  */
        if (main_loop_init()) {
            fprintf(stderr, "qemu_init_main_loop failed\n");
            exit(1);
        }

        if (init_timer_alarm(0)<0) {
            getDebugStream() << "Could not initialize timers" << '\n';
            exit(-1);
        }

        qemu_init_vcpu(env);
        cpu_synchronize_all_post_init();
        os_setup_signal_handling();
        vm_start();
        os_setup_post();
        resume_all_vcpus();
        vm_stop(RUN_STATE_SAVE_VM);

        m_forking = false;
        ...
```

The process run as a children process, so have todo some initialization in the begining. Then there are more QEMU functions called.

On the bottom of the file, there are a `extern "C" {}` block, which define some functions called from QEMU. Basically, those are wrapper functions to call the member functions defined in the `class S2E` class. For example, the following function definition:

```cpp
 S2E* s2e_initialize(int argc, char** argv,
            TCGLLVMContext* tcgLLVMContext,
            const char* s2e_config_file,  const char* s2e_output_dir,
            int verbose, unsigned s2e_max_processes)
{
    return new S2E(argc, argv, tcgLLVMContext,
                   s2e_config_file ? s2e_config_file : "",
                   s2e_output_dir  ? s2e_output_dir  : "",
                   verbose, s2e_max_processes);
}
```

It bascially return an initialized object to the caller.

On s2e_close, it first print a stack trace by calling the function ` print_stacktrace()`, which is defined at the begining of this file. Read the source of this function if you have time. I might be very valuable in implement this technique.
