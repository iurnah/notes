Linux System Call Caveats

## Questions I Have About System Call Interception

When I working with S2E's system call interceptor, there is a lot of caveats in implementing such an interceptor. This is because system call mechanism in Linux like system have been envolved for many years. In real systems, there are multiples of different instruction can do this. Generally speaking, Linux system call is implemented differently in the following method:

1. int 0x80h instruction
2. syscall instruction
3. sysenter, sysexit instruction through the VDSO (vsyscall) page
4. call *%gs:0x10 instruction (advanced instruction)

In the last case, it will ultimately make use of the previuos four instruction.

I am going to study and summarize all the details about those five cases in order to answer the following questions for my project.

1. How the system call is implemented in the linux I used?
2. How many possibilities it could be? (e.g. in library call, in source file, etc.)
3. In each case, how should I implement the interceptor in S2E? (core event onSyscall)
4. How the libc engaged with system calls?
5. Why should I hook the onExeception for 0x80 as discussed in this group [discussion](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?tab=om#search/s2e-dev%40googlegroups.com/140ee25edec05517)

## Research About System Call

It changes overtime, the syscall with number `__NR_foo` doesn't always belong to the kernel routine `sys_foo()`.

- 16-bit platform increase to 32-bit
| num | macro  | syscall |
|:-----:|:--------:|:---------:|
| 24  |`__NR_getuid`  |`sys_getuid16`|
| 199 |`__NR_getuid32`|`sys_getuid`  |

- Syscall naming convention: old v.s. new
| old | new  | newer |
|:--------:|:--------:|:------:|
|`__NR_oldolduname`|`__NR_olduname`|`__NR_uname`|
|`__NR_oldstat`|`__NR_stat` | `__NR_stat64`|

### Syscall by int 0x80 instruction

Legacy implementation of syscall mechanism, it is also the most inefficient way of carry out a syscall in linux system. [see this benchmark for details](https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/12/9/13)

### Syscall by `syscall` instruction in x86_64 platform

### `sysenter` and `sysexit` instruction in vsyscall page.

This might be widely implemented in x86 platform. Since the article ["About ELF Auxiliary Vectors"](http://articles.manugarg.com/aboutelfauxiliaryvectors.html), article ["Sysenter Based System Call Mechanism in Linux 2.6"](http://articles.manugarg.com/systemcallinlinux2_6.html), and reference [The Linux kernel, 4. System Calls](http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/lk/lk-4.html) all discussed this mecanism in details. We should mainly focus on this one to write our plugin.

The rest of work before start coding is to figure out how exactly the libc implemented syscall invocation and how system code implement system call. After that, we might need to study the onProcessLoad and onThreadCreate events. We should also study the WindowsMonitor plugin to design a complete LinuxMonitor plugin to support our System call interceptor and library call interceptor.
