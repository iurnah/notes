## Oprofile

Using Oprofile in virtual guest system such as virtualbox coundn't make use of the full capability of Oprofile. After installing Oprofile and linux debug image, you have to run the following command to enable the timer interrupt mode recording for Oprofile.

`$$ sudo modprobe oprofile timer=1` 

next running the following command routine to profile the system

```bash
$ sudo modprobe oprofile timer=1
$ sudo opcontrol --init
$ sudo opcontrol --vmlinux=/usr/lib/debug/boot/vmlinux-3.2.0-61-virtual
$ sudo opcontrol --reset
$ sudo opcontrol --start
#Using 2.6+ OProfile kernel interface.
#Reading module info.
#Using log file /var/lib/oprofile/samples/oprofiled.log
#Daemon started.
#Profiler running.
$ ./optest                      # the executable(s) that I wish to profile
$ sudo opcontrol --stop
#Stopping profiling.
$ sudo opcontrol --dump
$ opreport -l
```

> Usually, by default, your system's prebuilt binaries are stripped of their symbols. This means that all of these applications and libraries will be black boxes to OProfile as well. If, for whatever reason, a particular program seems to be bottlenecked in libc for example, and you want the profiler to break down whats happening in libc, you will need to install the version of libc that contains symbols (look for the -dbg package). Furthermore, if you want to profile some pre-built binary, you will need a version without the symbols stripped out.
