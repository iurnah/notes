Linkers and Loaders Notes

[TOC]

## 1. Why do we need linkers and loaders?

The basic job of any linker or loader is simple: it binds more abstract names to more concrete names, which permits programmers to write code using the more abstract names. That is, __it takes a name written by a programmer such as getline and binds it to "the location 612 bytes from the beginning of the executable code in module iosys.__" Or it may take a more abstract numeric address such as" the location 450 bytes beyond the beginning of the static data for this module'' and bind it to a numeric address.

- __Relocation:__ Relocation is the process of assigning load addresses to the various parts of the program, adjusting the code and data in the program to reflect the assigned addresses. In many systems, relocation happens more than once.
- __Symbol resolution:__ When a program is built from multiple subprograms, the references from one subprogram to another are made using symbols; a main program might use a square root routine called sqrt, and the math library defines sqrt. A linker resolves the symbol by noting the location assigned to sqrt in the library, and patching the caller's object code to so the call instruction refers to that location.

## 2. Two-pass linking

- __First pass:__ When a linker runs, it first has to scan the input files to find the sizes of the segments and to collect the definitions and references of all of the symbols It creates a segment table listing all of the segments defined in the input files, and a symbol table with all of the symbols imported or exported.

- __Second pass:__ Using the data from the first pass, the linker assigns numeric locations to symbols, determines the sizes and location of the segments in the output address space, and figures out where everything goes in the output file. The second pass uses the information collected in the first pass to control the actual linking process. It reads and relocates the object code, substituting numeric addresses for symbol references, and adjusting memory addresses in code and data to reflect relocated segment addresses, and writes the relocated code to the output file. It then writes the output file, generally with header information, the relocated segments, and symbol table information. If the program uses dynamic linking, the symbol table contains the info the runtime linker will need to resolve dynamic symbols. In many cases, the linker itself will generate small amounts of code or data in the output file, such as "glue code" used to call routines in overlays or dynamically linked libraries, or an array of pointers to initialization routines that need to be called at program startup time.

## 3. Architectural Issues

- __Intel 386 segmentation__: This is rarely used now days in 32-bit programs, consult references whenever needed.


## 4. Object Files
An object file contains five kinds of information.
- __Header information:__ overall information about the file, such as the size of the code, name of the source file it was translated from, and creation date.
- __Object code:__ Binary instructions and data generated by a compiler or assembler.
- __Relocation:__ _A list of the places in the object code that have to be fixed up when the linker changes the addresses of the object code._
- __Symbols:__ Global symbols defined in this module, symbols to be imported from other modules or defined by the linker.
- __Debugging information:__ Other information about the object code not needed for linking but of use to a debugger. This includes source file and line number information, local symbols, descriptions of data structures used by the object code such as C structure definitions.

The design of an object format is a compromise driven by the various uses to which an object file is put. A file may be ==*linkable*==, used as input by a link editor or linking loader. It my be ==*executable*==, capable of being loaded into memory and run as a program, ==*loadable*==, capable of being loaded into memory as a library along with a program, or any combination of the three. Some formats support just one or two of these uses, others support all three.

==Remember, that a programs that have been linked and are ready to run need no symbol nor relocation info.==

## 5. Linux/Unix ELF
ELF files come in three slightly different flavors: ==*relocatable, executable, and shared object*.== Relocatable files are created by compilers and assemblers but need to be processed by the linker before running. Executable files have all relocation done and all symbols resolved except perhaps shared library symbols to be resolved at runtime. Shared objects are shared libraries, containing both symbol information for the linker and directly runnable code for runtime.

ELF files have an unusual dual nature, [Figure 10](http://www.iecc.com/linker/linkerfig03-10.html). Compilers, assemblers, and linkers treat the file as a set of logical sections described by a section header table, while the system loader treats the file as a set of segments described by a program header table. A single segment will usually consist of several sections. For example, a "loadable read-only" segment could contain sections for executable code, read-only data, and symbols for the dynamic linker. Relocatable files have section tables, executable files have program header tables, and shared objects have both. The sections are intended for further processing by a linker, while the segments are intended to be mapped into memory.

### I. Relocatable Files

A relocatable or shared object file is considered to be a collection of sections, defined in section headers, Figure 12. Each section contains a single type of information, such as program code, read-only or read-write data, relocation entries, or symbols. Every symbol defined in the module is defined relative to a section, so a procedure's entry point would be relative to the program code section that contains that procedure's code.
```
Section header 

int sh_name;	// name, index into the string table 
int sh_type;	// section type 
int sh_flags;	// flag bits, below 
int sh_addr;	// base memory address, if loadable, or zero 
int sh_offset;	// file position of beginning of section 
int sh_size:	// size in bytes 
int sh_link;	// section number with related info or zero 
int sh_info; 	// more section-specific info 
int sh_align; 	// alignment granularity if section is moved 
int sh_entsize; // size of entries if section is an array

```

#### Section type include:
- __PROGBITS__: Program contents including code, data, and debugger info.
- __NOBITS__: Like PROGBITS but no space is allocated in the file itself. Used for BSS data allocated at program load time.
- __SYMTAB and DYNSYM__: Symbol tables, described in more detail later. The SYMTAB table contains all symbols and is intended for the regular linker, while DYNSYM is just the symbols for dynamic linking. (The latter table has to be loaded into memory at runtime, so it's kept as small as possible.)
- __STRTAB:__ A string table, analogous to the one in a.out files. Unlike a.out files, ELF files can and often do contain separate string tables for separate purposes, e.g. section names, regular symbol names, and dynamic linker symbol names.
- __REL and RELA:__ Relocation information. REL entries add the relocation value to the base value stored in the code or data, while RELA entries include the base value for relocation in the relocation entries themselves. (For historical reasons, x86 objects use REL relocation and 68K objects use RELA.) There are a bunch of relocation types for each architecture, similar to (and derived from) the a.out relocation types.
- __DYNAMIC and HASH:__ Dynamic linking information and the runtime symbol hash table.

#### There are three flag bit used:
- __ALLOC__: which means that the section occupies memory when the program is loaded.
- __WRITE__: which means that the section when loaded is writable.
- __EXECINSTR__: which means that the section contains executable machine code.

#### Sections include:
- __.text__: which is type PROGBITS with attributes ALLOC+EXECINSTR. It's the equivalent of the a.out text segment.
- __.data__: which is type PROGBITS with attributes ALLOC+WRITE. It's the equivalent of the a.out data segment.
- __.rodata__: which is type PROGBITS with attribute ALLOC. It's read-only data, hence no WRITE.
- __.bss__: which is type NOBITS with attributes ALLOC+WRITE. The BSS section takes no space in the file, hence NOBITS, but is allocated at runtime, hence ALLOC.
- __.rel.text, .rel.data, and .rel.rodata__: each of which is type REL or RELA. The relocation information for the corresponding text or data section.
- __.init and .fini__: each type PROGBITS with attributes ALLOC+EXECINSTR. These are similar to .text, but are code to be executed when the program starts up or terminates, respectively. C and Fortran don't need these, but they're essential for C++ which has global data with executable initializers and finalizers.
- __.symtab, and .dynsym__: types SYMTAB and DYNSYM respectively, regular and dynamic linker symbol tables. The dynamic linker symbol table is ALLOC set, since it's loaded at runtime.
- __.strtab, and .dynstr__: both type STRTAB, a table of name strings, for a symbol table or the section names for the section table. The dynstr section, the strings for the dynamic linker symbol table, has ALLOC set since it's loaded at runtime.
- __.got and .plt__: the Global Offset Table and Procedure Linkage Table used for dynamic linking (covered in Chapter 10).
- __.debug__: which contains symbols for the debugger, 
- __.line__: which contains mappings from source line numbers to object code locations again for the debugger. 
- __.comment__: which contains documentation strings, usually version control version numbers.

An unusual section type is .interp which contains the name of a program to use as an interpreter. If this section is present, rather than running the program directly, the system runs the interpreter and passes it the ELF file as an argument. Unix has for many years had self-running interpreted text files, using
```
#! /path/to/interpreter
```
as the first line of the file. ELF extends this facility to interpreters which run non-text programs. In practice this is used to call the run-time dynamic linker to load the program and link in any required shared libraries.

#### ELF symbol table

The ELF symbol table entries:
```
ELF symbol table entries

int name; // position of name string in string table 
int value; // symbol value, section relative in reloc, 
// absolute in executable 
int size; // object or function size 
char type:4; // data object, function, section, or special case file 
char bind:4; // local, global, or weak 
char other; // spare 
short sect; // section number, ABS, COMMON or UNDEF
```
- __UNDEF__ for undefined symbols.
- __ABS__ for non-relocatable absolute symbols. 
- __COMMON__ for common blocks not yet allocated. (The value of a COMMON symbol gives the required alignment granularity, and the size gives the minimum size. Once allocated by the linker, COMMON symbols move into the .bss section.

### II. Executable Files
An ELF executable file has the same general format as a relocatable ELF, but the data are arranged so that the file can be mapped into memory and run. The file contains a program header that follows the ELF header in the file. The program header defines the segments to be mapped. The program header, Figure 15, is an array of segment descriptions.
```
ELF program (executable) header

int type; // loadable code or data, dynamic linking info, etc.
int offset; // file offset of segment
int virtaddr; // virtual address to map segment
int physaddr; // physical address, not used
int filesize; // size of segment in file
int memsize; // size of segment in memory (bigger if contains BSS)
int flags; // Read, Write, Execute bits
int align; // required alignment, invariably hardware page size
```
