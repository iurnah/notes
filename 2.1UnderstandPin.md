## Architecture

### Instrumentation APIs:

### JIT Compiler:

Dynamically compile and instrument

### Emulation Unit:

It handle instructions that can't be directly executed(e.g., syscalls)

### Code cache:

Store compiled code

Pin's register Re-allocation, the original source code would be compiled as a trace program (can think as trace or instrumented program) to execute. What Pin essentially doing is to having the following binding for the original code and the generated trace. 

| Virtual | Physical |
|:---------:|:----------:|
| %eax | %eax |
|**%ebx** | **%esi** |
| %ecx | %ecx |
| %edx | %edx |


###Optimization 

**Trace linking technique? What's this?**

Inline + eflags Liveness Analysis + Scheduling

Pin distribution has a **address tracer** and **syscall tracer**, these pin-tools might need detailed investigated.
