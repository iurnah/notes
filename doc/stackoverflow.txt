As Deefour says, your situation isn't much unlike the one in How to change a
remote repository URI using Git?. When you clone a repository, it is added as a
remote of yours, under the name origin. What you need to do now (as you're not
using the old source anymore) is change origin's URL:

$ git remote set-url origin http://github.com/YOU/YOUR_REPO
If the original repository would update often and you want to get those updates
from time to time, then instead of editing origin it would be best to add a new
remote:

$ git remote add personal http://github.com/YOU/YOUR_REPO
Or maybe even call the old one upstream:

$ git remote rename origin upstream
$ git remote add origin http://github.com/YOU/YOUR_REPO
Then, whenever you want to get changes from upstream, you can do:

$ git fetch upstream
As this the source is a sample repository (seems to be kind of a template to
start off), I don't think there's a need to keep it nor fork it at all - I'll go
with the first alternative here.
